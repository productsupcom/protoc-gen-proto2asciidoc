# protoc-gen-proto2asciidoc

## About

proto2asciidoc is a [protoc](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases) plugin
that generates asciidoc documentation from the Protobuffer IDL files.

The goal of the project was to prevent API documentation inconsistenties
between the actual API and the docs.
By generating the code from the Protobuf definition the documentation is always
in sync.

The current version is a plugin, which is a from scratch rewrite of the previous one that
generated asciidoc too but parsed the Protobuffer files itself.

Can be used in conjunction with [code2asciidoc](https://github.com/productsupcom/code2asciidoc)
to produce even more consistent API documentation.

## Options

The following options for the plugin can be passed to protoc, the default for everything is off.

## Optional Extension

This tool assumes the extension in `asciidoc/extension` will be loaded when using
AsciiDoctor.

The following snippet can be used inside a Makefile.

<div class="note">

Of course you have to ensure that the directory is in a location your
Makefile can find it.
